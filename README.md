# HOW TO AUTO-CREATE RAID CONFIGURATION VIA iRMC DRIVER

Note::

   - Check MacAddress on Bare Metal Server then put value into
     ``export BM_MAC = `` in _auto_raid_cfg.sh
   - Change raid paras in ``tartget_raid_cfg.json`` based on
     ``sample_tartget_raid_config.rst``
   - If you only want to delete node in Ironic then run ``source _delete_node_bm``

Lets run ``source _auto_raid_cfg.sh`` to auto create raid cofiguration.

Take a coffee cup & relax!!!
